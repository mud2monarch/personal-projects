# Personal Projects
Repo for files related to my personal website, blogging, and other personal projects. Highlights include:

1. `/uni-schema/` A Rust script to download schemas for tables in Google BigQuery. I use this to export LLMs.txt-style documents to improve LLM querying.
2. `/ad_hoc_queries/binance_vs_interface.py` This code compares Binance volume against Uniswap Labs Interface volume as a way of 'normalizing' Labs Interface volume against industry growth generally.
3. `/ad_hoc_queries/jito_rest_api.py` A simple script to record the percentile fees for landed Jito transactions.
4. `Solana_atomic_arbs` A short review of atomic arbitrage data published by [Ghost](http://tryghost.xyz). Blog post located [here](https://zachrwong.info/a-short-exploration-of-solana-mev-data/).
