# Personal Projects
Repo for files related to my personal website, blogging, and other personal projects. Highlights include:

1. `/uni-schema/` A Rust script to download schemas for tables in Google BigQuery. I use this to export LLMs.txt-style documents to improve LLM querying.
2. `/cli_swap/` A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to interact with the Uniswap Protocol on Unichain Sepolia from the CLI. This is a very useful demo that demonstrates the differences between traditional and blockchain-based financial services in a very tactile way.
3. `/openrouter_tg_bot/` A primitive but functioning Telegram bot interface to the Openrouter API
4. `Solana_atomic_arbs` Charts and notebook for a short review of atomic arbitrage data published by [Ghost](http://tryghost.xyz). Blog post located [here](https://zachrwong.info/a-short-exploration-of-solana-mev-data/).
5. `/ad_hoc_queries/` A few scripts or notebooks for data analyses that I've done.
